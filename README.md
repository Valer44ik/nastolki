# Main idea
An application to save results of a BattleTech board game and assist in calculations through a campaign.
Two to four players are playing BT campaign.
Every campaign consists of several games (rounds).
Results of a real board game will be populated and stored by the app.
App will calculate parameters for the next game within campaign.
App will show history and statistics of a campaign.
No in game logic is required.
Will be possible to create/edit game entities (pilots, mechs, players, etc).
